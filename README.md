# CarniDIET-Shiny

A Shiny application to provide an interactive user interface for the CarniDIET database (repo: https://github.com/osmiddleton/CarniDIET-Database). 

Users of the Shiny app can view the spatial distribution of studies within CarniDIET as a whole or by individual, or multiple, taxonomic families or species. Users can download the full database using this Shiny app or for a subset of their choice.
